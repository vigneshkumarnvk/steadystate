    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

I work with the team from ACV Environmental that provides environmental services to the State of Connecticut. ACV has a DAS contract # 10PSX0294 that you can utilize. This contract covers Emergency spill response, disposal services, tank cleanings, catch basins, oil water separators to name a few. Please let me know if we can provide any of our services for you, or if you would like to meet to review a project. If I donâ€™t hear back in the next few days, I will give you a call.



Thank You,</textOnly>
