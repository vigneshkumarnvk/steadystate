    <textOnly>Hello {!Lead.Name},

Iâ€™m writing to follow up on my previous correspondence about providing information about services for your company, as I am confident you will find value in working with myself and ACV.

Please let me know how your calendar looks as I look forward to speaking with you soon.

Thanks</textOnly>
